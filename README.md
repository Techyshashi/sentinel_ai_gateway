# sentinel_ai_gateway
Sentinel AI Gateway is a hybrid edge-AI predictive maintenance system using MPU6050 and DHT11 on Arduino for real-time RMS/Kurtosis extraction. A TensorFlow LSTM model classifies machine health as SAFE/WARNING/CRITICAL. A local digital twin (Flask) stores state and a Streamlit dashboard visualizes live system data.
